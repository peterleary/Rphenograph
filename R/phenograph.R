#' RphenoGraph clustering
#'
#' R implementation of the PhenoGraph algorithm
#'
#' A simple R implementation of the
#' [PhenoGraph](http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(15)00637-6) algorithm, which is a
#' clustering method designed for high-dimensional single-cell data analysis. It works by creating a
#' graph ("network") representing phenotypic similarities between cells by calclating the Jaccard
#' coefficient between nearest-neighbor sets, and then identifying communities using the well known
#' [Louvain method](https://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/) in this graph.
#'
#' @param data matrix; input data matrix.
#' @param k integer; number of nearest neighbours (default:30).
#' @param directed logical; whether to use a symmetric (FALSE, default) or asymmetric ("directed",
#'   TRUE) graph.
#' @param edge_comb character map multiple edges to single edges; it uses igraph
#'   \code{igraph-attribute-combination}. If graph is directed, there should be no duplicated edge.
#'   If graph is undirected, there are numerous edges that exist in both directions. Those edges
#'   will be combined using the \code{simplify} function, that defines which function to apply to
#'   the weights. Available values are "sum", "prod", "mean", "min", "max"... "first" is used by
#'   default as duplicated links are getting the same weight (same intersection) and is equivalent
#'   to "mean". "sum" and "prod" are reinforcing the weight of links that exist in both directions.
#' @param inc_self logical; whether to include the 1st nearest neighbour, i.e. the data point
#'   itself, when computing the shared neighbours (intersection) with its nearest neighbours. By
#'   default, it is FALSE, as the original Rphenograph implementation. No self link is created,
#'   unless the data point is linked to none of its neighbours because they share no common
#'   neighbours.
#' @param clust_fun function; community detection algorithm. Defaults to cluster_louvain. Louvain is
#'   not implemented for directed graphs. Other options: cluster_walktrap, cluster_spinglass,
#'   cluster_leading_eigen, cluster_edge_betweenness, cluster_fast_greedy, cluster_label_prop.
#' @param verbose logical; verbosity (default=FALSE)
#' @param knn_fun function or character; the function used to search the nearest neighbors. NULL
#'   points to RANN::nn2 as original code, which is configured for exact nearest neighbours (eps=0).
#'   "hnsw" points to RcppHNSW::hnsw_knn as proposed by E. Becht. Any function that returns a matrix
#'   of index to nearest neighbors could be used. NB: the first column contains the point itself and
#'   is removed before building the graph unless inc_self is TRUE.
#' @param knn_report vector of integers; this vector defines the indices within the k nearest
#'   neighbours to report for each data points. This should be a vector of integer from 1 to k. A
#'   single value of 0 indicates that all neighbours (indices from 1 to k) will be reported, as by
#'   default.
#'
#' @return a list contains an igraph graph object for \code{graph_from_data_frame} and a communities
#'   object, for which the most interesting operations are the following:
#'
#'   \item{membership}{returns a numeric vector, one number for each vertex in the graph that was
#'   the input of the community detection.}
#'
#'   \item{length}{returns an integer scalar.}
#'
#'   \item{sizes}{returns a numeric vector.}
#'
#'   \item{modularity}{returns a numeric scalar.}
#'
#'   There are also other operations: \item{algorithm}{returns a character scalar.},
#'   \item{crossing}{returns a logical vector.} \item{is_hierarchical}{returns a logical scalar.},
#'   \item{merges}{returns a two-column numeric matrix.}, \item{cut_at}{returns a numeric vector,
#'   the membership vector of the vertices.}, \item{as.dendrogram}{returns a dendrogram object.},
#'   \item{show_trace}{returns a character vector.}, \item{code_len}{returns a numeric scalar for
#'   communities found with the InfoMAP method and NULL for other methods.}, \item{print}{returns
#'   the communities object itself, invisibly.}, \item{plot}{for communities objects returns NULL,
#'   invisibly.}
#'
#' @details
#'
#' The Python Phenograph algorithm defines a "prune" parameter. prune is a logical that determines
#' whether the graph is simplified (i.e. removing reciprocal edges) by addition (FALSE, default) or
#' multiplication (TRUE). Phenograph is using matrix operations, adjacency matrix of the graph added
#' or multiplied to its transpose. Originally, Rphenograph does not simplify the graph, keeping
#' reciprocal edges. Now Rphenograph offers igraph simplifications, which might lead to different
#' results from Phenograph. In Phenograph, it's not clear what's happening when a link exists in one
#' direction: does product lead to 0 when there is only one link?
#'
#' There is no rational whether to include or not to the data point itself in the list of nearest
#' neighbours. Phenograph does not, but the scran package does. The choice is driven here by
#' \code{inc_self}. Whatever the choice, the graph could be assymmetric when a point A lists B as
#' its k NN, but B does not, because B has k neighbours nearer than A. So A has a link to B, but B
#' has not link to A. When A and B are in the list of each other, there are two reverse links; A and
#' B have the same intersection and thus the same Jaccard coefficient.
